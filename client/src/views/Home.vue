This will make all the sections of WIDOCO to be in the `index.html`; and you will be able to see it in your browser. Note that the **LODE visualization will not be available** when exploring your ontology locally.\n* b) Create a local server: Set up a local server (e.g., using XAMPP or Tomcat) and serve the files WIDOCO generates (in the `htdocs` folder for Apache servers). \n\nIf you place the files generated by WIDOCO in a server and access them via its URL (for example, a Github page), you should be able to see your documentation appropriately.\n\t\n", "confidence": [1], "technique": "Header extraction"}], "download": [{"excerpt": "To download WIDOCO, you need to download a JAR executable file.

In addition, the following changes have been made:\r\n * Migrated the framework to use a recent version of OWL API (hence the size of the JAR)\r\n * Bug fixes in meta data (more to come in future releases)\r\n * Made WIDOCO more robust to errors\r\n * Published a benchmark of ontologies used to test WIDOCO. If you want us to try a new one, just open an issue!\r\n * Published a draft of the best practices for ontology annotation (currently under work). These are meant\r\n * Published  a showcase gallery with examples of WIDOCO's features\r\n * Published a report on the known usages by WIDOCO. \r\n\r\n![webvowl](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1520666/26068984/54eff946-3954-11e7-81b8-c72db0bd93bb.png)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/tarball/v1.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/zipball/v1.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/releases/tag/v1.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/releases/6390471", "dateCreated": "2017-05-13T23:26:12Z", "datePublished": "2017-05-15T16:53:34Z"}, {"tag_name": "v1.3.1", "name": "Widoco 1.3.1: Bug fixes and metadata enrichment", "author_name": "dgarijo", "authorType": "User", "body": "This release fixes several issues and extends LODE to accept more metadata options for defining terms and adding examples.\r\n* Fixed an issue with the changelog that produced an empty bullet when the domain or range of a property was an union or intersection.\r\n* Added tests with different ontologies that help inspecting whether a new change leads to errors or not.\r\n* Extended LODE to accept: prov:definition, vann:example, obo:definition (with the appropriate class name), obo:usageExample, vaem:rationale, skos:definition and terms:source.\r\n* Extended Widoco to accept terms:bibliographicCitation, bibo:status, bibo:doi and owl:backwardsCompatibleWith\r\n* If an error is produced while generating the changelog or the evaluation reports, the section is not generated.

For all classes, properties and data properties, Widoco will calculate the new changes, additions and deletions and present them in a human-readable manner. In order to benefit from this feature, you just have to annotate your ontology with the URI of the previous version. You can use owl:priorVersion, dc:replaces or prov:wasRevisionOf to annotate your ontology (Widoco will only consider one file to compare against).\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements:\r\n* RDF-a annotations are replaced with JSON-LD snippets. The page is just annotated with schema.org. The rdf-a annotations made it difficult to maintain, and the structured extraction tool provided by Google did not work. With the JSON-LD snippet everything is clearer. The provenance of the page itself is published separately.\r\n* Now it is possible to generate ONLY the cross reference section of an ontology.\r\n* Bug fix that led to errors when opening some ontologies like OBI\r\n\r\nOverview sample of the changelog:\r\n![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1520666/23640611/ac4407f6-02a3-11e7-8a88-b597ba740721.png)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/tarball/v1.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/zipball/v1.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/releases/tag/v1.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dgarijo/Widoco/releases/5659212", "dateCreated": "2017-03-07T03:06:28Z", "datePublished": "2017-03-07T03:17:36Z"}, {"tag_name": "v1.2.3", "name": "Widoco 1.2.3: [Bug fix] Licensius is optional", "author_name": "dgarijo", "authorType": "User", "body": "The Licensius web service has been unstable lately.
